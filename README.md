# True Random Dice Roller

A simple Python health roller for tabletop games. It uses regular expressions to interpret provided hit dice, then makes calls to the [Random.org API](https://api.random.org/features) to get true random results for each of the dice. While not able to do the many different types of rolls that my [Health Roller](https://github.com/AugmenTab/health-roller) can do, it was a fun experiment in APIs beyond just the Google Maps API I had done for [Aponia](https://github.com/AugmenTab/work-tools).
